# Farm-Advertisement-Logistic-Regression-and-Naive-Bayes  
(1) Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes algorithm to determine whether the corresponding ad is accepted or not (No libraries used).		
(2) Used bag-of-words model and the number of occurence of the words in each ad as it's feature.		
(3) Generated 6 points on the learning curve plot, using (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) random fraction on the training set and testing on the full set.
